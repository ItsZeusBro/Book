Buk is centered around this idea that the internet already has almost every piece of information you would ever want to know on just about any subject pertaining to human interests, and if its not already there it will get there in short order. This means the biggest problem pertaining to information is quality indexing. Yes, relevancy is a great way to find quality searches, but is it the only way? Probably not.

With this in mind, we are in search for the best search method (for any given subject) on any information on the next level of quality. This requires a logical and sorted compilation of information pertaining to any subject from a variety of sources pertaining to the subject, all in a single indexed document that you can rely on to remain constant for reference. This logical ordering can be done in a large variety of opinionated ways (flavors). "Logical flavors" are something certain people might be interested in, because they are very efficient at mentally searching for information in very particular ways. 

Basically indexed book files that are built from search engines and versioned (so that you can rely on its consistency while working on your disertation) is important. These are virtual books that contain referenced or hyperlinked strings from all kinds of sources that are compiled around a general search term or term of art. The point is, searching a subject in the same way every single time builds familiarty for those that are doing a deep dive in a very particular subject. Saving a powerful search pattern should always yield the same results that gave you reason to save the search pattern to begin with.
