# Buk
Its lyk a rlly long strng, but bttr.

Buks slvd the prblm of srchng and srtng a long tym ago... 

Snce then, computr science and mathematics has provided a set of prmtve tuls that aide in the same problem. The issue is that computr science looks at fyls that luk and act like "scrolls" of data. In my opnyn, fyls that luk and act like buks r bttr.

Jokes aside: 
- Ai might help us actually indx large strng docs in the form of book files one day.
This suggests that one day we may only hav "page files" and "buk files". 
A profound prophecy is that Ai may actually need to produce and consume its own buks one day just like other forms of intllgence.

Othr benefits: 
- Partial searching is better than exhaustv searching when you dont want rdundnt srch rsults, and when statistical relevancy can be apart of your indxing stratgy. Its specially importnt on huge data sets when the sngle best answr to a qstion is not important to answrng the qstion you want

- Indxs r functnly bout content withn a page or chptr. Thngs r ordrd by Ai based on content similarity in a vrtual way without chngng the undrlyng strng docs
- Glossaries r functionally "translation units", and anything havng to do with translations.
- References can just be hyperlinks

- Vrtual Indxng and Ordrng
  - Basically evry line in a docmnt (with some arbtry delmtr) can be vrtualy associatd with other lines by a computr (with map association to its orgnl location in the orgnl documnt)
  - This alows us to srch documents logicly irespectiv of its ordering.
  - The eficiency of this can be toned down to aide human readrs, and evntualy train them to be as eficient as computrs
