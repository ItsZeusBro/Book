To be content with what we at present know, is, for the\n","64":"most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very\n","65":"gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and\n","66":"emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set\n","67":"aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be\n","68":"daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and\n","69":"anxiety to acquire.\n","70":"\n","71":"And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\n","72":"progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\n","73":"persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu\n","74":"of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\n","75":"traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues\n","76":"of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\n","77":"superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\n","78":"credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as\n","79":"powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy\n","80":"scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of\n","81":"conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.\n","82":"History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent\n","83":"times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the\n","84":"indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are\n","85":"jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an\n","86":"ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.\n","87":"Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this\n","88":"troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is\n","89":"sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its\n","90":"demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere\n","91":"facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,\n","92":"is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical\n","93":"characters can only be estimated by the standard which human\n","94":"experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form\n","95":"correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a\n","96":"great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of\n","97":"beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents\n","98":"in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we\n","99":"must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than\n","100":"the respective probability of its details.\n"},"charOffset":"0"},"3":{"lineCount":"100","lines":{"1":"\n","2":"It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\n","3":"least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere[1] have, perhaps,\n","4":"contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\n","5":"other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all\n","6":"three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left\n","7":"us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\n","8":"follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in\n","9":"which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon\n","10":"everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or\n","11":"less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the\n","12":"contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know.

Before taking a brief review of\n","48":"the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken\n","49":"of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to\n","50":"Herodotus.\n","51":"\n","52":"According to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an\n","53":"early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of\n","54":"Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.\n","55":"Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named\n","56":"Critheïs. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the\n","57":"guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this\n","58":"maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the\n","59":"first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of\n","60":"Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Bœotia,\n","61":"whither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation.\n","62":"\n","63":"“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man\n","64":"named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being\n","65":"married, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he\n","66":"received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was\n","67":"her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made\n","68":"proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,\n","69":"willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,\n","70":"if he were carefully brought up.”\n","71":"\n","72":"They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\n","73":"had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\n","74":"attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\n","75":"died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon\n","76":"followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great\n","77":"success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,\n","78":"but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially\n","79":"in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these\n","80":"visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who\n","81":"evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,\n","82":"persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his\n","83":"travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him\n","84":"with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was\n","85":"fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities\n","86":"which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes\n","87":"consented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities\n","88":"of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by\n","89":"interrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote\n","90":"memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.[2] Having set\n","91":"sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes,\n","92":"who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes,\n","93":"who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical\n","94":"superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.\n","95":"Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became\n","96":"acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed\n","97":"the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it\n","98":"was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\n","99":"city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\n","100":"applied himself to the study of poetry.[3]\n"},"charOffset":"0"},"4":{"lineCount":"100","lines":{"1":"\n","2":"But poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan\n","3":"plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ.\n","4":"Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of\n","5":"one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continued the author,\n","6":"“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a\n","7":"recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot.

Having collected sufficient\n","40":"poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary\n","41":"publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.\n","42":"At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of\n","43":"the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more\n","44":"unintelligible than the human heart.”[8]\n","45":"\n","46":"Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\n","47":"merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him\n","48":"recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a\n","49":"profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at\n","50":"once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be\n","51":"setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a\n","52":"town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the\n","53":"seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a\n","54":"favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the\n","55":"imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn\n","56":"down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\n","57":"\n","58":"At Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\n","59":"Phocœa, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,\n","60":"reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,\n","61":"which we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from\n","62":"Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were\n","63":"pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus\n","64":"(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up\n","65":"quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some\n","66":"time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a\n","67":"place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to\n","68":"him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places\n","69":"and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting\n","70":"to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;\n","71":"and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade\n","72":"him sup.[9]\n","73":"\n","74":"“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according\n","75":"to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O\n","76":"Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs\n","77":"their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,\n","78":"whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\n","79":"\n","80":"Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.\n","81":"Having finished supper, they banqueted[10] afresh on conversation,\n","82":"Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had\n","83":"visited.\n","84":"\n","85":"At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\n","86":"resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\n","87":"Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left\n","88":"Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,\n","89":"a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole\n","90":"story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to\n","91":"what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and\n","92":"feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the\n","93":"stranger to him.\n","94":"\n","95":"Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,\n","96":"assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon\n","97":"showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general\n","98":"knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the\n","99":"charge of his children.[11]\n","100":"\n"},"charOffset":"0"},"5":{"lineCount":"100","lines":{"1":"Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the\n","2":"island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of\n","3":"Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.\n","4":"“To this day,” says Chandler,[12] “the most curious remaining is that\n","5":"which has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the\n","6":"coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have\n","7":"been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock.

He also testifies his gratitude to\n","27":"Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”\n","28":"\n","29":"His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to\n","30":"visit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is\n","31":"said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity\n","32":"of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,[14] he\n","33":"sent out for Samos.

The\n","56":"majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the\n","57":"Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the\n","58":"Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”\n","59":"\n","60":"Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics\n","61":"has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the\n","62":"Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he\n","63":"proceeds:—\n","64":"\n","65":"“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of\n","66":"things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the\n","67":"region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The\n","68":"creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for\n","69":"the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were\n","70":"in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly\n","71":"explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in\n","72":"all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”[16]\n","73":"\n","74":"From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of\n","75":"human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic\n","76":"investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue.

A. Wolf,\n","51":"turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\n","52":"published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of\n","53":"the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by\n","54":"no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously\n","55":"announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent\n","56":"portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into\n","57":"any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of\n","58":"Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards\n","59":"that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem\n","60":"could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their\n","61":"composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect\n","62":"symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived\n","63":"by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to\n","64":"posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be\n","65":"indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,\n","66":"was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive\n","67":"integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey.

Few\n","80":"things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,\n","81":"opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than\n","82":"Wolf himself.

Many of these, like those of the negroes in the\n","48":"United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\n","49":"around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\n","50":"spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\n","51":"mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\n","52":"which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\n","53":"was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\n","54":"and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\n","55":"recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\n","56":"probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\n","57":"memory considerably.\n","58":"\n","59":"“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\n","60":"poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most\n","61":"probably the former.

He\n","68":"therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\n","69":"rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging\n","70":"arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,\n","71":"arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast\n","72":"pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere\n","73":"arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’\n","74":"\n","75":"“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,\n","76":"recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.

But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\n","37":"philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,\n","38":"that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have\n","39":"been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:\n","40":"every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the\n","41":"various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day\n","42":"the gods of poetry.\n","43":"\n","44":"\n","45":"We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\n","46":"author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a\n","47":"variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.\n","48":"Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could\n","49":"have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by\n","50":"their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has\n","51":"observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single\n","52":"quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters\n","53":"of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of\n","54":"Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that\n","55":"of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:\n","56":"the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;\n","57":"that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we\n","58":"find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and\n","59":"generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be\n","60":"found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each\n","61":"character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to\n","62":"give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters\n","63":"of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,\n","64":"that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,\n","65":"open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and\n","66":"this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of\n","67":"his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\n","68":"upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these\n","69":"kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open\n","70":"manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,\n","71":"where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to\n","72":"those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of\n","73":"Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and\n","74":"we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of\n","75":"Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of\n","76":"Statius’s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the\n","77":"same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,\n","78":"Hippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem\n","79":"brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this\n","80":"tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic\n","81":"writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,\n","82":"the invention of Homer was to that of all others.\n","83":"\n","84":"\n","85":"The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;\n","86":"being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,\n","87":"of those who utter them.

On this last\n","63":"consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of\n","64":"his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of\n","65":"supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were\n","66":"joined.

As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these\n","72":"epithets is a short description.\n","73":"\n","74":"\n","75":"Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\n","76":"share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not\n","77":"satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of\n","78":"Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this\n","79":"particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered\n","80":"these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and\n","81":"accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater\n","82":"smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has\n","83":"a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its\n","84":"custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make\n","85":"the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.\n","86":"With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the\n","87":"feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its\n","88":"accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the\n","89":"licence of poetry.

Out of all\n","93":"these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not\n","94":"only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world.

If the Grecian poet has\n","8":"not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the\n","9":"only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than\n","10":"the other.

It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow\n","13":"with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than\n","14":"to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,\n","15":"with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise\n","16":"us like the sound of a trumpet.

It is that which forms the character of each part of\n","23":"his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more\n","24":"extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and\n","25":"strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his\n","26":"sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full\n","27":"and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers\n","28":"more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with\n","29":"regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his\n","30":"character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of\n","31":"comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in\n","32":"them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.\n","33":"We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and\n","34":"distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider\n","35":"him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No\n","36":"author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and\n","37":"as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that\n","38":"we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a\n","39":"more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer\n","40":"possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of\n","41":"both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in\n","42":"comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the\n","43":"better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\n","44":"Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\n","45":"leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\n","46":"profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\n","47":"Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a\n","48":"river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold\n","49":"their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they\n","50":"celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all\n","51":"before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,\n","52":"calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the\n","53":"action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And\n","54":"when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in\n","55":"his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the\n","56":"heavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling\n","57":"with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his\n","58":"whole creation.\n","59":"\n","60":"\n","61":"But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\n","62":"naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to\n","63":"distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As\n","64":"prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment\n","65":"decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or\n","66":"extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we\n","67":"look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections\n","68":"against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this\n","69":"faculty.\n","70":"\n","71":"\n","72":"Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which\n","73":"so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\n","74":"probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\n","75":"gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,\n","76":"exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become\n","77":"miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit\n","78":"something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable\n","79":"performances.

The force of this\n","86":"faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine\n","87":"itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is\n","88":"grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,\n","89":"however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes\n","90":"are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its\n","91":"proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with\n","92":"occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his\n","93":"manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when\n","94":"his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent\n","95":"images.

Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations\n","23":"and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three\n","24":"thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\n","25":"themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to\n","26":"be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means\n","27":"alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates\n","28":"their dislike, will become a satisfaction.\n","29":"\n","30":"This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of\n","31":"the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the “far-darting\n","32":"Phœbus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed Achilles,” &c.,\n","33":"which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those\n","34":"of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to\n","35":"belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the\n","36":"rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of\n","37":"attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all\n","38":"occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets\n","39":"of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature\n","40":"of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names\n","41":"derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction\n","42":"of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of\n","43":"birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,\n","44":"Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c. Homer, therefore,\n","45":"complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive\n","46":"additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something\n","47":"parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\n","48":"Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,\n","49":"&c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for\n","50":"the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the\n","51":"world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the\n","52":"brazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other men; a divine\n","53":"race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by\n","54":"the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.”[39] Now among the\n","55":"divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in\n","56":"common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an\n","57":"epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their\n","58":"families, actions or qualities.\n","59":"\n","60":"What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\n","61":"deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the\n","62":"course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious\n","63":"endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should\n","64":"think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one\n","65":"would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these\n","66":"critics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written first; a\n","67":"consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have\n","68":"always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they\n","69":"overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and\n","70":"moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which\n","71":"might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man,\n","72":"and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of\n","73":"the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed;\n","74":"as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when\n","75":"the very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus\n","76":"that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select\n","77":"those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some\n","78":"that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger\n","79":"in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean\n","80":"expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener\n","81":"from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in\n","82":"the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\n","83":"Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to\n","84":"a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer,\n","85":"and that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the\n","86":"great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his\n","87":"times, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of\n","88":"this principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of\n","89":"the cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality\n","90":"the consequences of his merit.

As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,\n","21":"such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice\n","22":"it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in\n","23":"every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too\n","24":"much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the\n","25":"first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and\n","26":"unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his\n","27":"proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to\n","28":"take as he finds them.\n","29":"\n","30":"It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in\n","31":"our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no\n","32":"literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior\n","33":"language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that\n","34":"a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no\n","35":"less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the\n","36":"modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there\n","37":"is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a\n","38":"version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but\n","39":"those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,\n","40":"and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will\n","41":"venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by\n","42":"a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours\n","43":"by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.\n","44":"It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator\n","45":"should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his\n","46":"managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving\n","47":"this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than\n","48":"he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret\n","49":"in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;\n","50":"and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in\n","51":"his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours\n","52":"as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to\n","53":"be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of\n","54":"a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been\n","55":"more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his\n","56":"translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\n","57":"sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\n","58":"simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\n","59":"sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the\n","60":"certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in\n","61":"his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an\n","62":"unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes\n","63":"one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be\n","64":"envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of\n","65":"style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and\n","66":"the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and\n","67":"dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as\n","68":"much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:\n","69":"it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.\n","70":"Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.\n","71":"\n","72":"This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\n","73":"Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the\n","74":"inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words\n","75":"but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that\n","76":"part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his\n","77":"style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books\n","78":"than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what\n","79":"has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,\n","80":"induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those\n","81":"general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a\n","82":"veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;\n","83":"as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the\n","84":"Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.\n","85":"\n","86":"For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\n","87":"should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\n","88":"proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have\n","89":"something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned\n","90":"gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which\n","91":"would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more\n","92":"ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.\n","93":"\n","94":"Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of\n","95":"Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill\n","96":"effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other\n","97":"seems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of\n","98":"modern terms of war and government, such as “platoon, campaign, junto,”\n","99":"or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be\n","100":"allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat\n"},"charOffset":"0"},"19":{"lineCount":"100","lines":{"1":"the subjects in any living language.\n","2":"\n","3":"There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction, which are a sort of\n","4":"marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first\n","5":"sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as\n","6":"defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I\n","7":"speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the\n","8":"former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the\n","9":"purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide\n","10":"easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the\n","11":"ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which\n","12":"have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are\n","13":"become familiar through their use of them; such as “the\n","14":"cloud-compelling Jove,” &c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as\n","15":"fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded\n","16":"one, the course to be taken is obvious.\n","17":"\n","18":"Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one\n","19":"or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the\n","20":"epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous\n","21":"translated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords a majestic idea in the\n","22":"periphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.” Others that\n","23":"admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a\n","24":"judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are\n","25":"introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, ἑκηβόλος or\n","26":"“far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect\n","27":"of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical,\n","28":"with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where\n","29":"Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former\n","30":"interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would\n","31":"make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to\n","32":"avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in\n","33":"Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already\n","34":"shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one\n","35":"may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an\n","36":"additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in\n","37":"doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his\n","38":"judgment.\n","39":"\n","40":"As for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of\n","41":"whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\n","42":"hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,\n","43":"as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor\n","44":"to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not\n","45":"ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders\n","46":"it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods\n","47":"to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or\n","48":"where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn\n","49":"forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the\n","50":"best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the\n","51":"repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one\n","52":"may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed\n","53":"translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is\n","54":"to answer for it.\n","55":"\n","56":"It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)\n","57":"is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every\n","58":"new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of\n","59":"poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it\n","60":"in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may\n","61":"sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed\n","62":"of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed\n","63":"this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to\n","64":"all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who\n","65":"have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.\n","66":"\n","67":"Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing\n","68":"justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may\n","69":"entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him\n","70":"than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those\n","71":"of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an\n","72":"immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce\n","73":"any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent\n","74":"interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the\n","75":"thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty\n","76":"verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one\n","77":"might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of\n","78":"his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a\n","79":"strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;\n","80":"insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries\n","81":"he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the\n","82":"obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a\n","83":"fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the\n","84":"tragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &c.

The whole scene between Achilles\n","16":"    and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose\n","17":"    of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly\n","18":"    skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the\n","19":"    Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of\n","20":"    Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if\n","21":"    genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil\n","22":"    the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this\n","23":"    account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is\n","24":"    called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the\n","25":"    poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of\n","26":"    Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in\n","27":"    gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and,\n","28":"    lastly, mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives that the hero is\n","29":"    softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of\n","30":"    the conqueror. The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha\n","31":"    geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the\n","32":"    Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage\n","33":"    defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no\n","34":"    name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can\n","35":"    only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to\n","36":"    transfuse it into another language.”—Coleridge, p. 195.\n","37":"\n","38":" [296] “Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot\n","39":" but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic\n","40":" age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive\n","41":" vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by\n","42":" the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil\n","43":" inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but\n","44":" made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the\n","45":" body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites\n","46":" essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions of\n","47":" the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary\n","48":" shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus\n","49":" to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows\n","50":" how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must\n","51":" have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death,\n","52":" was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding\n","53":" up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for\n","54":" even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution.”—Mure,\n","55":" vol. i. 289.\n","56":"\n","57":" [297] Such was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken.\n","58":"\n","59":"“Here, from the tow’r by stern Ulysses thrown,\n","60":"Andromache bewail’d her infant son.”\n","61":"\n","62":"Merrick’s Tryphiodorus, v. 675.\n","63":"\n","64":" [298] The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant\n","65":" and interesting view of Helen’s character—\n","66":"    “Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand\n","67":"    that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us\n","68":"    also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is\n","69":"    through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech,\n","70":"    noble in her associations, full of remorse for a fault for which\n","71":"    higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate\n","72":"    towards those with whom that fault had committed her. I have always\n","73":"    thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and\n","74":"    hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as\n","75":"    almost the sweetest passage in the poem.
